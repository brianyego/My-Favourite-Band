            <b>Bio</b> <br> <br>
            Hart the Band, made up of Wachira Gatama, Kenneth Muya and Mordecai Mwini have regaled us over the years with their music.

Their breakthrough track Uliza Kiatu earned them a legion of fans while Nikikutazama, their most viewed song on YouTube with 1.9million views established them among Kenya’s top tier singing groups.

But how well do you know the trio? Well, here are facts you might not know about them.The band was formed in 2012 when the trio met at KNT during a play on cancer awareness.

After the show, Kenneth played soundtracks on his guitar and after finding themselves idle, voila, H_art the Band was born.

What’s in a name?

Describing themselves as very artistic, the group revealed the inspiration behind their unorthodox name in a past interview.


“(It) means art from the heart. The underscore is the bridge between the heart and art because aside from music we do art as well,” they said.

Discovered they can sing after forming the band

You’d think that members of a music band would first figure out their singing capabilities before coming together, right? Not in this case.

After hearing Mordecai sing, that’s when Kenneth and Wachira knew that they too could sing.

Kayole massive

Wachira, Kenneth and Mordecai all hail from Kayole, in Nairobi’s Eastlands area. Mordecai once revealed that due to lack of fare, they had to walk all the way from Kayole to Pangani for an audition. I like them because of the Team-spirit and determination.
