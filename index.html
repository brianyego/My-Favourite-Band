            <b>Bio</b> <br> <br>
            Hart the Band, made up of Wachira Gatama, Kenneth Muya and Mordecai Mwini have regaled us over the years with their music.

Their breakthrough track Uliza Kiatu earned them a legion of fans while Nikikutazama, their most viewed song on YouTube with 1.9million views established them among Kenya’s top tier singing groups.

But how well do you know the trio? Well, here are facts you might not know about them.
        </p>
        <p>
            They met at Kenya National Theatre (KNT)


The band was formed in 2012 when the trio met at KNT during a play on cancer awareness.

After the show, Kenneth played soundtracks on his guitar and after finding themselves idle, voila, H_art the Band was born.

What’s in a name?

Describing themselves as very artistic, the group revealed the inspiration behind their unorthodox name in a past interview.
